  In this project data has been collected from one of the international news agencies – Euronews. The data has been collected for a total of four weeks - first two week of December 2019 and 2020. The aim of the project is comparing the news 2019 and 2020 for the first two week of December, and to identify the changes, patterns and differences.The news title, date and the new links have been collected, and the news authors have been planned to be collected, but non-existence of Authors’ name on defined news webpages’ scraped pages made it impossible within this project.
